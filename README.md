# UOL Results 2018
Python web scraper to check your results in your stead!

## Dependencies
This script is using three helper libraries to carry out its functions.
 - Mechanical Soup (A replacement for Mechanize library in Python 3.x)
 - Beautiful Soup
 - Twilio SMS 
   
Install the dependencies through pip installer using their respective names.

## How to run?
Once the dependencies have been installed, you will have to enter your particulars as required in "<>" brackets in the source code.  
Then, run the script to check if the results are out yet.  

## Advance
You can place the code in the loop, configured for a certain interval to keep it runnning so you will get the SMS when the results could be out!  
Be the first to know your results among your friends.

## Disclaimer
This script is by no means production ready and written in 15 mins so it's definitely not the most efficient one.  
I have tried to configure to the best of the students' needs but since the university is constantly changing their structure, there are also chances it may not work.  
However, have fun out of this experience and most importantly, run the script at your own risk.  
I do not store any information nor will bear any responsibilities from running this script.
